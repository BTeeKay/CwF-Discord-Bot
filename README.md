# CwF-Discord-Bot
INTRO:

This is to be a collaborative project to setup a fully functioning Discord bot. This project is for a combined effort of coding students who want to work with people starting out like them. The bot will function for a server named “Coding with Friends” which will be a hub for people new to coding.
The discord server can be found here:

FUNCTIONALITY: 

My initial plan for the bot is to be able to use it for role assignment and FAQs. An individual user should be able to join the server and then type a command to get a role. They will be able to see a list of commands from the bot and select the role that is suitable for them. It will also be able to see set messages and give predefined answers.

FUTURE:

As I myself am a student coder, my vision for after the initial stage is not set. The only boundaries for future score are the future abilities of myself and the people that come on board. 

LET’S GO!
